<H1>Spin The Wheel</H1>
<P>
  Did you know that seemingly useless literary trivia could win you prizes? Now
  is your chance to showcase your literary sense and convince yourself that all
  the time you spent gathering trifles to show off wasn’t such a complete waste
  after all.

<H2>Rules</H2>

<P>
  A phrase, author’s name or English idiom will be put on the screen, but the
  letters will not be visible to the participant. Participants will have 90
  seconds to guess all the letters of the phrase, author’s name or English
  idiom. The participant will spin a wheel before the game starts to land on a
  prize that they could potentially win if they guess all the letters on the
  screen before time runs out. The wheel can have wild spokes like “no prize for
  this round” or “Lose a turn”, so all the best and may the odds be in your
  favour!
</P>
