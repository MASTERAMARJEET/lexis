<H1>Impromptu</H1>
<P>
  Can you find something happy in a desolate painting of a desert? Or something
  sad in a wholesome portrait of a reunion? In Impromptu, we shall try to see
  two sides of a coin in each picture. This event will test your ability to
  improvise on conventional interpretations of the world and let your tongue run
  loose. Who knows-you may surprise yourself by the uniqueness of the ideas you
  bring, ideas nobody else would ever have seen! Join us, and show us a
  different way of looking at things.
</P>

<H2>Prelims</H2>

One picture with maximum two switches. You start by giving a positive/negative
interpretation of the picture, and each time moderator says switch, you change
to negative/positive. Total time: 30s
<H2>Finals</H2>

Maximum of 6 switches with the same rules. Total time 60s.
