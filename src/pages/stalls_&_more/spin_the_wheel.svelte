<H1>Spin The Wheel</H1>
<P>
  Did you know that seemingly useless literary trivia could win you prizes? Now
  is your chance to showcase your literary sense and convince yourself that all
  the time you spent gathering trifles to show off wasn’t such a complete waste
  after all.

    Based on the category, words will appear on the screen, but the letters will
    not be visible to the participant.
  </li>

    Participants will have 60 seconds to guess all the letters of the
    phrase/idiom, author’s/poet’s name or poem/book title with a maximum of 10
    wrong guesses.
  </li>

    If participants guess correctly, they will get the chance to spin the wheel
