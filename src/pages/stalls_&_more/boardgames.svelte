<H1>Board Games Night</H1>
<P>
  Who doesn't have fond memories of playing board games? Those days, when you
  couldn't go outside (or didn’t want to), you’d gather all your friends and sit
  down for a long session of Scotland Yard or Cluedo or Monopoly. To bring back
  the nostalgia and rekindle your love for them, Lexis 3.0 presents Board Game
  Night. Hand-picked with classics as well as new entries, we welcome you to a
  night of extraordinary amusement with friends and strangers alike. Who knows,
  you might find some new friends in the process too!
