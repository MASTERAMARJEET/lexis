<H1>Reading Room</H1>

<P>
  The Reading Room was one of the most praised aspect of Lexis last year and we plan to give the people what they want.  A cozy reading nook where everyone is welcome to read their favorite books. We give you the ambience, you just relax! 
</P>

<H2>Outline: </H2>
<LIST>
  <li>Books will be available in the reading room (donated by students) so it's not necessary for people to carry their own books.
  </li>

  <li>If someone carries their own book they will have to enter their book in a book/paper at the main counter where volunteers will keep track of this list.
  </li>

  <li> Volunteers will keep an eye on the people inside the room at all times to ensure there are no problems and avoid external disturbances (by keeping the door closed).
  </li>

  <li>
  The room will be decorated suitably to give the ambience of it being a “cozy reading nook”.
