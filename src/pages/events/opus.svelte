  Opus is a chance for artists and literature enthusiasts to put their skills to the test. How well can you decipher a book and use your creativity to put together a cover that captures its essence? In Opus we find out how effectively your book cover catches a reader's eye and allures them to itself. There are stories that need your illustrations!
