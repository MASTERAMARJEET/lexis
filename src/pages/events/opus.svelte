  We are told not to judge a book by its cover. But let's admit it, they are the
  ones that grab our attention and tempt us to reach out towards the bookshelf.
  Whether covered with layers of references slowly peeled off as you pore
  through the pages, or giving you a feel of what is about to ensue, book cover
  rightly serves as the gateway to your promising journey. So why not try out
  this exciting art form for yourself?
