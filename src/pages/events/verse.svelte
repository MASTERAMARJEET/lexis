<H1>Verse</H1>
<H2>2:00 PM on 15th Oct @ G06</H2>
<P>
  A pen, a paper and a few words. That's all it takes for a downpour of emotions
  on paper. Poetry is a country, a form, a language at its most powerful and
  pristine form, a tempest that has the vigour to touch the soul with even a
  single verse.

<P>
