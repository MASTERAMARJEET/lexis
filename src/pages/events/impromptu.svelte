<H1>Impromptu</H1>
<H2>10:30 AM on 15th Oct @ G06</H2>
<P>
  Can you find something happy in a desolate painting of a desert? Or something
  sad in a wholesome portrait of a reunion? In Impromptu, we shall try to see
  two sides of a coin in each picture. This event will test your ability to
  improvise on conventional interpretations of the world and let your tongue run
  loose. Who knows-you may surprise yourself by the uniqueness of the ideas you
  bring, ideas nobody else would ever have seen! Join us, and show us a
  different way of looking at things.
</P>

<H2>Prelims</H2>
In the preliminary round, a picture will be shown to the participant. They start off giving a positive/negative interpretation of the picture, and each time the moderator says switch, you change to negative/positive. Total time to speak per person will be 30 seconds. Max. 2 switches.
A demo will be given for this.

<H2>Finals</H2>
The finalists will be playing a game of PowerPoint karaoke: They must deliver a presentation based on a set of slides they have never seen before.
Judges will choose winners based on relevant criteria (creativity, clarity, appropriateness, and persuasiveness, among other things.)
