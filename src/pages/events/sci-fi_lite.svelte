  “ We spend our entire lives trying to tell stories about ourselves –they’re
  the essence of memory. It is how we make living in this unfeeling accidental
  universe tolerable. That we call such a tendency “the narrative fallacy”
  doesn’t mean it doesn’t also touch upon some aspect of the truth. Some stories
  simply literalize their metaphors a bit more explicitly. ” - Ken Liu

  Sci-fi, as the name suggests, is the science fiction event of Lexis 2.0 where
  you can finally materialize the obnoxious ideas in your mind which were
  perhaps lost to logic in a long journey of thoughts. This is a creative
  writing (and drawing!) event wherein we will provide the instructions and
  questions a week before Lexis 2.0 takes place. Stay tuned!
