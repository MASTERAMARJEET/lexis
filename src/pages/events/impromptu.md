# Impromptu

Can you find something happy in a desolate painting of a desert? Or something sad in a wholesome portrait of a reunion? In Impromptu, we shall try to see two sides of a coin in each picture.
This event will test your ability to improvise on conventional interpretations of the world and let your tongue run loose. Who knows–you may surprise yourself by the uniqueness of the ideas you bring, ideas nobody else would ever have seen! Join us, and show us a different way of looking at things.

## Prelims

One picture with maximum two switches.
You start by giving a positive/negative interpretation of the picture, and each time moderator says switch, you change to negative/positive.
Total time: 30s

## Finals

Maximum of 6 switches with the same rules—total time 60s.
