# Coffee, Cigarates and More

Story Writing is an art. Coherent story writing in a short period is an art more remarkable still. And a cohesive story, when all your trains of thought get interrupted by almost unrelated prompts that seemingly come out of nowhere, is an art that surpasses all.

So join us in this mind-fuddling exercise and try to make sense of the nonsense surrounding us, pen down your thoughts, and bring out the storyteller in you!
